## Top 5 Best Connecticut Zipcodes to Invest In 



### I. Overview

I have been hired by a real-estate investment firm to help them understand:

* How real estate prices have changed overtime and,
* How to use this information to invest in areas with the most potential value increase.
* To get me started I have been provided with a dataset from Zillow Research

 #### Home values
Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.

 #### Housing Bubble
On December 30, 2008, the Caseâ€“Shiller home price index reported its largest price drop in its history.
The credit crisis resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble is an important cause of the Great Recession in the United States.

### II. Business Problem

What are the top 5 best zip codes for us to invest in?
Let's begin by defining best:

* What makes the value of a property go up?
* Law of Supply and Demand.  Property values rise when a low supply of homes for sale meets strong buyer demand, as buyers compete in bidding wars to secure a home from the limited inventory.
* Return On Investment
* Average price over time
* Jobs Market
* Population growth
* Access to the city center or other relevant landmarks
